## 4. Improvement Notes (From Analysis)

- **Conversion**: The "Get Your Score" tool is a great lead magnet. 
- **CTA**: There is a mix of Black and Orange CTAs. Harmonizing these (e.g., Orange for primary actions) could improve conversion.
- **Visibility**: Some text has lower contrast (80% opacity), which might be an accessibility concern.
- **Programs**: The accordions in the original design hid important selling points. In the redesign, we should default these to expanded or use a grid layout to make the value proposition immediately visible.
